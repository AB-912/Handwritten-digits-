# Handwritten-digits-Recognization-using-SVM
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect handwritten digits using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. I used the scikit-learn library to load the dataset and visualized it using various data analysis and visualization tools.To train the model, I split the dataset into 75% for training and 25% for testing. I used the training data to train the SVM model and then evaluated its accuracy on the testing data.Through this project, I gained experience in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using the SVM algorithm. This project also helped me to develop skills in model evaluation and optimization.Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to develop and implement machine learning models for real-world applications. I am excited to continue building on these skills and contributing to innovative projects in the field of machine learning.
